          "question": "What types of projects do you take on?",
          "answer": "We handle a wide range of software projects—from AI-powered systems and custom web applications to native iOS apps and full SaaS platforms. Whether you need a complete build from scratch or want to enhance existing systems, we can help."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does your development process work?",
          "answer": "We start with a discovery call to understand your goals and requirements. Then we provide a detailed proposal with scope, timeline, and investment. Once approved, we work in iterative sprints with regular check-ins so you're never in the dark about progress."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you offer fixed-price or hourly engagements?",
          "answer": "Both. For well-defined projects, we offer fixed-price quotes so you know exactly what to expect. For ongoing development or projects with evolving requirements, hourly or retainer arrangements often make more sense. We'll recommend the best fit for your situation."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does a typical project take?",
          "answer": "It varies widely by scope. A marketing website might take 2-4 weeks, while a custom SaaS platform could span several months. During our discovery call, we'll provide realistic timelines based on your specific requirements."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens after launch?",
          "answer": "We don't disappear after deployment. We offer ongoing support, maintenance, and enhancement packages to keep your software running smoothly. Many clients work with us on a retainer basis for continuous improvements and new features."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you work with our existing team?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. We frequently collaborate with in-house developers, designers, and product managers. Whether you need us to lead the project or augment your existing team, we adapt to what works best for you."
